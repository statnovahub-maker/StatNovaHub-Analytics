# Crime Hotspot Analysis (R)

🚧 **Project Status:** Work in Progress

## Overview
This project explores spatial patterns of crime incidents using
data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, clustering techniques,
and geospatial visualization.

The goal is to identify crime hotspots and support data-driven
insights for public safety and urban analysis.

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (time, location, offense categories)
- K-means clustering
- Geospatial visualization and interactive mapping

## Tools
- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- leaflet

## Current Progress
- Data cleaning completed
- Exploratory analysis completed
- Initial spatial clustering completed
- Interactive visualizations generated

## Next Steps
- Temporal trend analysis
- Cluster validation
- Expanded reporting and interpretation
